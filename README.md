# Traffic Sign Classification
The problem addressed by this project lies in the current challenges faced in accurately classifying traffic signs from images, as it is a critical component for ensuring road safety, enhancing driver assistance systems, and enabling successful navigation for autonomous vehicles. Existing classification methods often suffer from limited accuracy and robustness, leading to potential risks, inefficiencies, and compromised traffic management. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop an efficient and reliable system that leverages machine learning techniques to precisely classify traffic signs, enabling timely and accurate recognition, fostering safer road environments, optimizing driver assistance systems, and facilitating the seamless integration of autonomous vehicles into the transportation ecosystem.
